                    Hi there! My name is Benjamin! I'm a 3 year old Rhodesian Ridegeback
                    and I am known as the troublemaker of the house. Whenever I get bored 
                    I like to steal socks and other clothing from my humans and hide it 
                    for them to find later. When I'm not stealing clothing, I'm stealing any 
                    food that gets in reach. I'm a big boy, I already weigh over 100 pounds 
                    and can reach most counter tops by just reaching my neck up. During the 
                    day I mostly like to sleep and watch TV with my humans or steal items around
                    the house and make the humans chase me around to get them back. There's also 
                    no door that can hold me back either! Some might tell me I'm too smart for 
                    my own good since I know how to open doors and will come and go as I please
                    when I want attention. I love to run around the house and play tag but I hate
                    to exercize. Sometimes when my humans take me out for a walk I decide I'm too 
                    tired and make one of them come drive me home. It's a rough life being a dog! 
                    They understand right?
